# SITVEE

Special Events Virtual Tickets System

Our project is to provide a web service of virtual tickets that are used in mobile phones by the implementation of QR codes, which will be sent to the emails of each one of the attendees of the event that is being organized.

This system of tickets for events comes to digitize and organize the process of exchanging benefits by companies during the events that take place, this digitization and order are achieved from the content of a friendly website for the person in charge of organizing the event in the company, giving you the opportunity to introduce each of the attendees and the benefits that are going to be able to exchange during your participation in the activity.
